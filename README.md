Great — thanks for sharing both the code and the reference PDF. Based on your **Streamlit + PostgreSQL Client Query Management System** code and the guidelines in your document, I’ve prepared a **well-documented README** for your project.

# 📌 Client Query Management System

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Client Query Management System** is a full-stack Streamlit application that enables clients to **submit queries** and support teams to **manage, track, and resolve them efficiently**.
It uses **PostgreSQL** as the backend database, **Pandas** for data handling, **Plotly** for visualization, and **Streamlit** for the frontend.

This system helps organizations:

* Organize incoming client queries.
* Monitor progress with real-time dashboards.
* Improve resolution times and customer satisfaction.
* Track support team performance with metrics and trends.

---

## 🛠️ Features

### 👨‍💻 Client Side

* **Secure Login & Registration** (role-based authentication).
* **Submit New Queries** with details:

  * Email ID, Mobile Number, Heading, Description, Priority.
* **Track Submitted Queries**:

  * View all past queries.
  * Visualize status distribution (Open, In Progress, Resolved).
  * Monitor resolution progress over time.

### 🎧 Support Side

* **Dashboard Overview**:

  * Metrics: Total queries, In Progress, Resolved.
  * Visualizations: Status breakdown (pie chart), Query trends (line chart).
* **Manage Queries**:

  * Filter by status.
  * Update query status (Open → In Progress → Resolved).
  * Assign queries to agents.
* **Performance Tracking**:

  * Query load per day.
  * Average resolution time.

## 🗂️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* **Backend**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with SQLAlchemy ORM
* **Visualization**: [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
* **Libraries**: `pandas`, `hashlib`, `sqlalchemy`, `psycopg2`, `datetime`
* **Authentication**: SHA-256 password hashing

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/client-query-management.git
cd client-query-management
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt**

```
streamlit
pandas
sqlalchemy
psycopg2
plotly
```

### 3️⃣ Configure PostgreSQL

* Create a database named `Client_query`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Client_query;
```

* Update your database credentials in the code:

```python
DB_URL = "postgresql+psycopg2://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/Client_query"
```

### 4️⃣ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🔑 Default Users

The system initializes with two default accounts:

* **Support Admin**

  * Username: `support_admin`
  * Password: `support123`
  * Role: `support`
* **Client User**

  * Username: `client_user`
  * Password: `client123`
  * Role: `client`

---

## 📊 Dataset

* The app loads sample queries from a CSV (Google Drive link configured in the code).
* Columns include:

  * `client_name`, `email_id`, `mobile_number`, `query_heading`,
    `query_text`, `status`, `priority`, `submitted_on`, `resolved_on`, `assigned_to`.

---

## 📷 Screenshots (Optional)

* **Client Dashboard** – Submit and track queries.
* **Support Dashboard** – Monitor and manage queries.

(Add screenshots here once the app is running.)

---

## 📈 Business Use Cases

1. **Query Submission Interface** – Clients raise tickets in real-time.
2. **Query Tracking Dashboard** – Support teams monitor workload.
3. **Service Efficiency** – Measure query resolution speed.
4. **Customer Satisfaction** – Faster query resolution improves trust.
5. **Support Load Monitoring** – Identify bottlenecks and backlogs.

---

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

* Maintainable & modular Python code.
* Secure authentication with password hashing.
* Clear Streamlit UI with forms and tables.
* Real-time database operations with PostgreSQL.
* Well-documented README and project repository.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* 🔐 JWT or OAuth-based authentication.
* 📷 File/image uploads with BLOB storage.
* 📧 Email notifications on query updates.
* 📊 SLA tracking for overdue queries.
* 🌐 Deployment on cloud (Heroku/AWS/Streamlit Cloud).
